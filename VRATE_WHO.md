## Decsription:
VRATE is an app that enables students to rate every lecture, everyday. The main problem we faced as FY's was, that we didnt understand what teachers teach. Also there is a significant section of class who cannot approach teacher's directly incase they have any problem. VRATE solves all these problems. To start with, we have limited it to the First Year's of VJTI.
Students have to complete the Sign Up process first, once that's done student can login through an unique email id and password.As soon as Login is done student is directed to a calendar cum time table page. As we have 6 batches for FY, so while logging in the system checks the batch of student from the database and accordingly respective time table is displayed. On tapped on a particular subject, a rating page displays. Here user can rate the particular lecture on a rating scale of 1 to 5 stars. If user rates less , giving the desired valid reason for it is *mandatory* . Also while commenting student identity is kept hidden.
So in this way this app would be a very good platform for students to keep their problems as well as teacher's to improvise.
